# dwmblocks-async
![dwmblocks screenshot](https://file.coffee/u/ASrRqPY8RLKzLY.png)
My very minimal build of the dwmblocks-async status bar for my build of dwm, [perfectwm](https://github.com/SpyHoodle/perfectwm).

## scripts
I store my scripts in `.local/bin`, which is added to my `$PATH`.<br>
You can find my scripts in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/SpyHoodle/dotfiles).

## installation
**Note:** DWM needs the [status2d](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/status2d/) patch for colours.

Clone the git repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/SpyHoodle/dwmblocks
```
Change directory to dwmblocks
```sh
cd dwmblocks
```
Make and install dwmblocks
```sh
make install
```
